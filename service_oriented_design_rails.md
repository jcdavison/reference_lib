#### Key questions to think about compartmentalizing a service

  - Which data has high read and low write fequency ?
  - Which data has high write or update frequency ? 
  - Which joins occur most frequently ? 
  - Which parts of the app have clearly defined requirements and design ? 

  * these questions lead to paritioning based on;

  - iteration speed
  - logical function
  - read/write
  - joins
