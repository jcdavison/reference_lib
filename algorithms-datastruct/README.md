### Algorithms and Data Structures

"I've been coding at the basic level long enough to know the basics, it is time to increase the complexity of what I do."

Given a set of inputs, and algorithm is something that is used to process said inputs and return a given set of outputs.  An algorithm must finish and in order to be classified as a working algorithm, it must finish and always produce the expected outputs.

Measuring an algorithm is based on establishing how long an algorithm takes to finish and how much space it requires to run.
