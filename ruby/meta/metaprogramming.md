## META PROGRAMMING IN RUBY

things to understand ? Class Intance Variables, Class Macros, Around Aliases

### The Object Model

Module path names work just like a file structure

```ruby
module M
  class C
    X = "constant"
  end
end

M::C::X

module M
  Y = "constant"
  class C
    ::M::Y
    # to move up the tree
  end
end

module M
  class C
    Module M2
      Module.nesting # [M::C::M2, M::C, M]
    end
  end
end
```

* DEF: receiver, the object that a method gets called on.
* DEF: ancestors chain, the heierarchy of classes from a class to Object.
- note; private methods are called with the implicit receiver self


### CALLING METHODS DYNAMICALLY, aka, Dynamic Dispatch

- consider a yaml file, with  admin: john title: house hunting
- and the keys are in a conf file that will be parsed and then initialized, but you can't plan on knowing in advance what keys will be present,
- consider using .send to dynamically insert methods...

```ruby
  yamlconfdata.each do |k,v|
    SomeObject.send("#{k}", v)
  end
```
- the send method is very useful for dynamically inserting the method to be called
- send can also be used to call an object's private methods, so play nice

```ruby 
  class MyClass
    define_method :method_name do |arg|
      arg * 1
    end
  end
```

- dynamically defining methods can be extremely usefull for iterating on objects and turning attributes into methods.

#### Generating Methods through introspect.

Consider the use of `define_method`.  We can look at all the instance methods of an object and any method that matches a particular regexp, the value of the regexp match can be sent to `define_method` and then the parent object will have a dynamically define method to acces.

Consider the definition of the `DS` object the way `Computer` is dynamically giving itself certain methods.

```ruby
class DS
  def initialize # connect to data source...
  end

  def get_cpu_info(workstation_id) # ...
    "2.9 Ghz quad-core"
  end 

  def get_cpu_price(workstation_id) # ...
    120
  end
  
  def get_mouse_info(workstation_id) # ...
    "Wireless Touch"
  end
  
  def get_mouse_price(workstation_id) # ...
    60
  end
  
  def get_keyboard_info(workstation_id) # ...
    "Standard US"
  end
  
  def get_keyboard_price(workstation_id) # ...
    20
  end

  def get_display_info(workstation_id) # ...
    "LED 1980x1024"
  end

  def get_display_price(workstation_id) # ...
  # ...and so on
    150
  end
end

ds = DS.new
ds.get_cpu_info(42)     # => "2.9 Ghz quad-core"
ds.get_cpu_price(42)    # => 120
ds.get_mouse_info(42)   # => "Wireless Touch"
ds.get_mouse_price(42)  # => 60

class Computer
  def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
    @id = computer_id
    @data_source = data_source
    data_source.methods.grep(/^get_(.*)_info$/) { Computer.define_component $1 }
  end  

  def self.define_component(name)
    define_method(name) do
      # ...
      info = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_info", @id
      price = @data_source.send "get_#{name}_price", @id
      result = "#{name.capitalize}: #{info} ($#{price})"
      return " #{result}" if price >= 100
      result
    end
  end
end

c = Computer.new(1, DS.new)
c.cpu # => " Cpu: 2.9 Ghz quad-core ($120)" 
c.mouse # => "Mouse: Wireless Touch ($60)"
```

The above pattern is intersting as we've removed duplication in `Computer` though there is an unique dependency in `define_component` around `send "get_#{nam}_detail"`, ie, `define_method` is prepopulated with a method name.

##### method_missing()
  
- Object has method_missing() defined on it, useful for catching the bubble up on methods that don't exist.
- if you override it at the class or superclass level, you can use it to make 'ghost methods' and do stuff dynamically.
- basically, you create a catch all, to an object "if someone sends a message that you don't understand, do this"
- consider something like a csv, with methods .rows_with_attribute called, sometimes that attribute might change, but if the Object has something like .rows_with(:attribute), a method_missing catch could regex the .rows_with_attributes and convert it into a correctly behaving rows_with(:arg) call. very useful, I think this is how rails must do find_or_create_by_attribute stuff 
- method_missing is useful for implementing the behavior of an OpenStruct type object.

Unlike the above `Computer` code, `method_missing` can be used to define the methods as they are called, which checks that the `DS` object has the method and then calls the corresponding code properly.

```ruby
require_relative 'data_source'

class Computer
  def initialize(computer_id, data_source)
    @id = computer_id
    @data_source = data_source
  end

  def method_missing(name)
    super if !@data_source.respond_to?("get_#{name}_info")
    info = @data_source.send("get_#{name}_info", @id)
    price = @data_source.send("get_#{name}_price", @id)
    result = "#{name.capitalize}: #{info} ($#{price})"
    return "* #{result}" if price >= 100
    result
  end
end
c = Computer.new 2, DS.new
c.mouse #=> "Mouse: Wireless Touch ($60)"
```
A defined ghost method won't return `true` on a `respond_to?` call but since `respond_to?` uses `respond_to_missing?`, we can override `respond_to_missing?` in situations where we know we have ghost methods.

```ruby
class Computer
  def respond_to_missing?(method, include_private = false)
    @data_source.respond_to?("get_#{method}_info") || super
  end
end
c = Computer.new 2, DS.new
c.respond_to?(:mouse)   # => true
```

Consider 

```ruby
class MyOpenStruct 
  def initialize
      @attributes = {}
  end

  def method_missing(name, *args) 
    attribute = name.to_s
    if attribute =~ /=$/
      @attributes[attribute.chop] = args[0]
    ï¿¼else
      @attributes[attribute]
    end 
  end
end
```

- method_missing basically converts anything that attempts to set '=' an attribute into a key in the hash.
- this can also be really useful for gems that hit 3rd party api's, think that if an attribute suddently become avail, you don't have to wait for the gem to be updated to get access to it. 

- consider that if you use ghost methods, you might want to deal with .responds_to? basically check for the presence of ghost attribute || Super
- note that in the case that a ghost method conflicts with a defined method elsewhere in the ancestors, the defined method takes priority.
- because of the lookup process, ghost methods def run slower.
- note, _send_ or __id__ are reserved ruby methods, not to be used publicly or overwritten.


The key to being able to dynamically generate methods is understanding that an object can introspect at run time, an object has inheritance that dictates where it looks for methods, methods can be defined and undefined at run time and and object has the ability to dynamically respond to methods that aren't defined.  The first patterns concretely defines method at time of object instantiation and the second method defines the methods as they are called when the object realizes it doesn't naturally have them defined.

### BLOCKS AND CALLABLE OBJECTS, maybe reread about the notion of a clean room.

```ruby
  def a_method(a, b)
    a + yield(a,b)
  end

  a_method(1,2) {|a,b| (a + b) * 3}
```

- the block gets passed straight into the method and then gets run with yield.
- note, that using begin end, if you add ensure, that code gets run no matter if an exception rises.

- blocks bind to the scope where they are created

```ruby

def greet
  x =  "Goodbye"
  yield("cruel")
end

x = "Hello"
greet {|y| "#{x}, #{y} world" } # => "Hello cruel world"
```

- all scopes have access to local_variables()
- a scope gate is a fixed barrier between closures
- it could be useful to create a new class with a block and then the scope bindings will allow for 'flattening the scope'

```ruby
  my_var = "Success"
  MyClass = Class.new do
    puts "#{my_var} in the class definition!"
      define_method :my_method do
        puts "#{my_var} in the method!"
      end 
  end
  MyClass.new.my_method # => Success in the class def, Success in the method.
  ```

  - the proper name for above is 'nested lexical scope' but effectively, using a method binds the local vars to the block
  - scope sharing can be attained by defining methods in the same flat scope as the variable.

```ruby 
  def define_methods
    shared = 0
    Kernel.send :define_method, :counter do 
      shared
    end
    Kernel.send :define_method, :inc do |x| 
      shared += x
    end
  end
  define_methods
  counter       # => 0
  inc(4)
  counter       # => 4
```

-  Object.instance_eval {} is a useful tool to pass scope through the gate consider

```ruby
  var = 1
  object.instance_eval { @v = var }
  object.instance_eval { @v } # => 1
```

A more formal name for the above, 'instance probe' as a small snippet of code is being dipped into the object and doing things.

#### Deferred evaluation is the process of defining a proc, a objectified block, and calling it later.

```ruby
  inc = Proc.new {|x| x + 1}
  inc.call(2) # => 3
```

- the kernal methods lambda and proc basicaly are factories for Procs
- & converts blocks to procs and backwards as well, useful for passing a block to another method

### CLASS DEFINITIONS
- a method that applies to one and only one actual object, read not a class, is a singleton.
- consider

```ruby
  str = "just a regular string"
  def str.title? 
    self.upcase == self 
  end
  # .title? is a singleton cause it can only be called on str
```

##### SOME HARD TRUTHS
  
- Classes are just objects, class names are just constants, call a method on a class is the same as call a method on an object.
- effectivley, class methods are singleton methods, the EigenClass is the ghost class created to encapulate the hierarchy of where a singleton methods comes from.

##### THE GREAT UNIFIED THEORY

- class, eigenclasses, modules, instance methods, class methods and singleton methods combine to form 7 rules

##### 7 RULES OF THE RUBY OBJECT MODEL
  
1. There is only one kind of object, be it a regular object or a model.
2. There is only one kind of module, be it regular module, class, eigenclass or proxy class.
3. There is only one kind of method, and it lives in a module, most often a class.
4. Every object, classes included, has it own real class, be it a regular class or an eigenclass.
5. Every class has exactly one superclass, with the exception of BasicObject, which has none, this means that ther is a single ancestors chain from any class up to BasicObject.
6. The superclass of the EigenClass of an object is the object's class. The superclass of the eigenclass of a class is the eigenclass of the class's superclass.
7. When you call a method, Ruby goes 'right' in the receiver's real class and then up the ancestors chain, that is all there is to know about the way ruby finds methods.

##### EXTENDING MODULES AS CLASS METHODS

```ruby
  module MyModule
    def my_method; 'hello'; end
  end
  class MyClass 
    class << self
      include MyModule
    end
  end

  MyClass.my_method # => 'hello'
```

##### EXTENDING MODULES ONTO OBJECTS

```ruby
  module MyModule
    def my_method; 'hello'; end
  end
  obj = Object.new
  class << obj
    include MyModule
  end

  obj.my_method # => 'hello'
  # extend works as a method and class macro

  obj.extend MyModule

  class MyClass
    extend MyModule
  end
```

##### ALIAS

```ruby
  class MyClass
    def method1; "hey" end
    alias :m :method1
  end

  obj = MyClass.new
  obj.m # => 'hey'
  obj.method1 # => 'hey'
```
