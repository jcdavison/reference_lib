### modules of focus

cluster
domain
https
net
server
process - this needs further tinkering with
stream - my understanding of this is very skin deep


### topics of further research

what is a unix socket?
what do i need to know about tcp?
ip versioning
datagram, not entirely sure I have a model of how that would be best used.
node VM


### things i've ignored
punycode - unstable and not something that needs much research, look it up when you need it

```javascript
punycode.toASCII('ma√±ana.com')
```

REPL
timer
TLS - I get what this is doing but I don't need to dig into it in this moment.
TTY - used to handle terminal interface issues, not digging into in this moment.
